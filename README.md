# Fable.Vue

Initial bindings for Fable and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

The idea is not to create a clone of Elmish/Fable.React that can be used with a different render, but adapt to Vue standards (HTML templates, components) to make Fable an interesting choice for Vue developers.

## Quick test

Run `npm i` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to compile the elastic-header sample. Then browse to `localhost:8080`.
